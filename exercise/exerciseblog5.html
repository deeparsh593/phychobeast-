            Protein Is a Basic Need Of Human Being Protein is necessary for muscle repair and growth. But When It Comes
            To Right Answered About Whey Protein For Beginners We Have To First Lean About What is Whey Protein? 
            Whey protein is a mixture of proteins isolated from whey, which is the liquid part of milk that separates 
            during cheese production. Milk actually contains two main types of protein: casein (80%) and whey (20%). 
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Whey is found in the watery portion of milk. When cheese is produced, the fatty parts of the milk coagulate 
            and the whey is separated from it as a byproduct. If you’ve ever opened a yogurt container to see liquid 
            floating on top — that’s whey. Cheese makers used to discard it before they discovered its commercial value 
            After being separated during cheese production, whey goes through various processing steps to become what 
            people generally recognize as whey protein — a powder that is added to shakes, meal replacements and protein
             bars. Whey protein doesn’t taste very good on its own, which is why it’s usually flavored. Chocolate-, 
             vanilla- and strawberry-flavored powders are popular. It’s important to read the ingredients list, as some
              products may have unhealthy additives like sugar. Taking whey protein is a convenient way to add protein 
              on top of your daily intake. This can be important for bodybuilders and gym enthusiasts, as well as people 
              who need to lose weight or are simply lacking protein in their diet. Most flavored whey proteins are also 
              rather delicious and can be used to add an incredible taste to healthy recipes like smoothies. Whey is 
              generally well tolerated, though people with lactose intolerance need to be careful, and some people may 
              even be allergic to it .
          </p>
        
          <p>
            When Should We Take Whey Protein? People often wonder when the best time to take their protein powder is.
            This depends on your health and fitness goals. You may want to consume it at a particular time of day, 
            depending on whether you want to lose weight, build muscle or preserve muscle. Here are the best times to 
            take protein based on your specific goals .</p>

            <p>
              Losing Weight Protein is one of the most important nutrients for fat loss. Eating a high-protein
              diet can help raise your metabolism and reduce your appetite. Protein helps curb your appetite by
               reducing levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin, all while increasing levels of appetite-reducing 
               hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY) and cholecystokinin (CCK).This 
               means consuming a protein-rich snack between meals may lead you to eat fewer calories later in 
               the day. One study found people who ate a high-protein yogurt snack during the afternoon ate 100 
               fewer calories at dinner, compared to those who ate crackers or chocolate as an afternoon snack. 
               The yogurt, crackers and chocolate all provided the same number of calories .To reap the most 
               weight-loss benefits, aim to eat plenty of protein-rich foods throughout the day. Building Muscle
                Protein is important for building muscle. In order to build muscle and strength, you need to 
                consume more protein than your body breaks down naturally during resistance training or weight 
                lifting. The best time to consume protein for optimal muscle growth is a controversial topic. 
                Fitness enthusiasts often recommend taking a protein supplement 15–60 minutes after exercise. 
                This time frame is known as the “anabolic window” and said to be the perfect time for getting 
                the most out of nutrients like protein. However, recent research has shown that this window is
                 much larger than previously thought. According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition,
                  consuming protein any time up to two hours after your workout is ideal for building muscle mass.
                   For the average person, resistance exercise and consuming sufficient protein are more important
                    than timing protein intake. That said, people training in a fasted state, like before breakfast,
                     may benefit from taking protein shortly after a workout, as they haven’t consumed protein in a 
                     while.</p>
                     <p>
                      What is the Right Way To Consume Whey Protein? When It comes to Consuming Whey Protein There 
                      Are Two Ways To Consume It a) With Water Or b) With Milk. It Also Depends On Your Specific Goal 
                      While You Are Gaining Weight Or Muscles If I Talk About Muscle Building When Water Is a Better 
                      Choice Because We Only Wants Protein At That Time on the Other Hand If You Are Gaining Weight In 
                      This Case Milk Is a Good Option Because With Milk We Also Consume Other Micro Nutrients.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Overall Whey Protein Is Good For Every One No Matter You Are Beginner Or Advanced Whey is a natural 
                      Source Of Protein
